# TEUX-FLOWY
  This Project is our take on popular note taking application [Workflowy](https://www.workflowy.com/) with calendar view inspired by another note taking application [TeuxDeux](https://teuxdeux.com/).

`TeuxFlowy` was coded in framework `React.js` with `React Router @6` and firebase as a backend and database.

## Overview

  This application was our final project at the `infoShare Academy's Front-end Bootcamp`. The applications goal was to create a platform that enables creation of notes that can be edited in realtime by multiple users.

## Feauters

  `TeuxFlowy` allows its users to create infinitely nested lists that can be shared and edited by multiple users. The application has two major views `List view` inspired by `Workflowy` and `Calendar view` inspired by `TeuxDeux`.

### List view

  `List view` enables users to create, remove and edit notes in realtime. Each note can be set as the master note for the purpose of more comfortable edition.


### Calendar view

  `Calendar view` enables users to view notes that have assigned date to them in a card-like view for easier daily task management.
